### 👨‍💻 About Me

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from `Universidade Federal de Itajuba`.

I'm a passionate software engineer with experience with:

- AWS
- Node
- Vue
- Docker
- Systems Design
- CICD pipelines (Github Actions and Bitbucket pipelines)
- And a lot more.

My strengths in software engineering lie in creativity and problem-solving, while my weakness is algorithms. I'm not a leet coder or competitive programmer, and I'm sure that doesn't make me a bad engineer.


### 💼 Looking For

I’m actively seeking opportunities to create products using:

- AWS CDK for scalable infrastructure
- JavaScript & Vue.js for frontend and full-stack applications
- Serverless & Cloud architectures for high-availability solutions

I have a preference to work for Startups

<b>Work Type:</b> Remote | full-time
